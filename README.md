# Team-Tower

Hi. We are Team Tower and this is our school project called Torni web app.
Our web application is designed for the Torni hotel in Tampere.
The application's main purpose is to help workers in the hotel to manage tasks easier with our notes.
The workers can see their department's notes and add notes to other departments.
The managers can manage users and see all the departments' notes.

If you have further questions about the app or the code please send us email to taturi@metropolia.fi
